# How_to_do_style_transfer_in_tensorflow

##Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/Oex0eWoU7AQ) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the Intro to Deep Learning Nanodegree with Udacity. We're going to re-purpose the pre-trained VGG16 convolutional network that won the ImageNet competition in 2014 for image classification to transfer the style of a given image to another. [This](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) is the original paper on the topic.


##Dependencies

* tensorflow 
* matplotlib 
* python 3

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install missing dependencies

##Usage

Run `jupyter notebook` in the top level directory and the code will pop up in your browser.
